        <h1>Question Of the Day(QuOD)</h1>
        
        <h2 id="QuOD">Can you stab a person with a brick?</h2>
        
        <p>This answer for this depends on if you think the corner of a brick is a pointed wepeon. The definition of stabbing is" thrust a knife or other <b>pointed</b> weapon into (someone) so as to wound or kill."(stab)</p>
        <p>This shows that it depends on if you think the brick is pointed. The edge would be the most pointed and it is sharp. Your finger could even get cut on the edge, but it is completly up to you if you whether a brick is pointed. You  might think one thing and someone else the other.</p>

        <p>But that is just one side. In the defintion it says, "as to wound or kill." The thing is, it might kill someone or wound someone, but it would not be deep and just be a scratch. So yes or non you choose.</p>
